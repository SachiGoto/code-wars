// Write a function called LCS that accepts two sequences and returns the longest subsequence common to the passed in sequences.

// Subsequence
// A subsequence is different from a substring. The terms of a subsequence need not be consecutive terms of the original sequence.

// Example subsequence
// Subsequences of "abc" = "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc" and "abc".

// LCS examples
// LCS( "abcdef" , "abc" ) => returns "abc"
// LCS( "abcdef" , "acf" ) => returns "acf"
// LCS( "132535365" , "123456789" ) => returns "12356"
